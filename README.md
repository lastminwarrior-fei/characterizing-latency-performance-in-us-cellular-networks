# Characterizing Latency Performance in US Cellular Networks 

Despite much research focusing on improving the latency performance of cellular networks, the status quo experienced by users of real-world networks in the United States today is not well understood. In this project, we analyze latency measurements collected by the FCC from mobile devices on cellular networks across the United States over the past three years. Through this data, we identify the 'typical' latency performance, as well as specific factors that are related to worse-than-usual latency: low signal strength, usage during peak times, and handover. We further characterize the interaction of these factors with other relevant conditions (e.g., metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan location). Next, we recreate these 'problem' scenarios in an emulated cellular network experiment on the POWDER research platform. We share the results of the data analysis and the reference experiments on POWDER to help advance future research on low latency cellular networks.
